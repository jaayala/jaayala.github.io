However, it is no clear how the implantation of this new paradigm will affect the power consumption of the network. To shed light on this relatively unexplored topic, we evaluate and analyze the power consumption of virtualized Base Station (vBS) experimentally. In particular, we measure the power consumption associated with uplink transmissions as a function of different variables such as traffic load, channel quality, modulation selection, and bandwidth. We find interesting tradeoffs between power savings and performance and propose two linear mixed-effect models to approximate the experimental data.

To overcome this obstacle, we propose an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) framework for jointly configuring the service and wireless network parameters, towards maximizing the analytics' accuracy subject to minimum frame rate constraints. Our experiments with a bespoke prototype reveal the volatile and system/data-dependent performance of the service, and motivate the development of a Bayesian online learning algorithm which optimizes on-the-fly the service performance.

We propose a framework for optimizing the number and location of CUs, the function split for each BS, and the association and routing for each DU-CU pair. We combine a linearization technique with a cutting-planes method to expedite the exact problem solution. The goal is to minimize the network costs and balance them with the criterion of centralization, i.e., the number of functions placed at CUs. Using data-driven simulations we find that multi-CU vRANs achieve cost savings up to 28% and improve centralization by 77%, compared to single-CU vRANs. Interestingly, we see non-trivial trade-offs among centralization and cost, which can be aligned or conflicting based on the traffic and network parameters. Our work sheds light on the vRAN design problem from a new angle, highlights the importance of deploying multiple CUs, and offers a rigorous optimization tool for balancing costs and performance.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal Deployment Framework for Multi-Cloud Virtualized Radio Access Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

This work proposes a self-optimization algorithm capable of finding the optimal configuration in an operating network. We address the problem using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, in which the actions are the IC configurations, whose performances are initially unknown. The main difficulty is that, due to the variable network conditions, the performance of each action may change over time. Our proposal is based on two main elements: the sequential exploration of subsets of actions (exploration regions), and an optimal stopping strategy for deciding when to end current exploration and start a new one. For our algorithm, referred to as Local Exploration with Optimal Stopping (LEOS), we provide theoretical bounds on its long-term regret per sample and its convergence time. We compare LEOS to stateof-the-art learning algorithms based on multi-armed bandits and policy gradient RL. Considering different changing rates in the network conditions, our numerical results show that LEOS outperforms the first alternative by 22%, and the second one by 48% in terms of average regret per sample.","tags":null,"title":"Online Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Interference Coordination","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

Our proposal is based on a contextual bandit formulation that, among other challenges, implies discovering the most energy-efficient control actions while satisfying a predefined level of Quality of Service (QoS) for the users. We propose a two-level framework comprising a global controller, in charge of a group of macro cells, and multiple local controllers, one per macro cell. The global controller implements a novel algorithm, referred to as the Bayesian Response Estimation and Threshold Search (BRETS), that is capable of learning, for each control action, its feasibility boundaries in terms of QoS and its energy consumption as a function of the aggregated user traffic. The algorithm comes with a bound on its expected convergence time. The local controllers translate the control actions learned by the global controller into local decisions.

On the other hand, interference coordination is a key aspect in HetNets resource management which directly affects the performance and energy consumption. Although these two aspect are intertwined, they have been studied separately so far. In this paper, we address the joint problem of energy saving and interference coordination in HetNets. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) leveraging two facts: the user traffic demands usually follow periodic patterns, and the knowledge and prediction of network load is crucial in order to select efficient network configurations. Quality of Service (QoS) in the network is defined as the ratio of users meeting a requirement specified by the operator, and allows us to account for a minimum QoS requirement by including a constraint in the formulation of the MDP. To address this MDP, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm which selects energy efficient farsighted configurations with QoS guarantees achieving near optimal performance. This ADP algorithm is built upon: 1) the certainty equivalent control principle, which simplifies the complexity of the MDP, and 2) machine learning techniques: a neural network and a polynomial regressor which allow us to predict the QoS and the consumption of the network in advance. We evaluate our proposal in a LTE-A network simulator following the 3GPP guidelines, and the results obtained show that a joint control of the energy saving and interference coordination mechanisms results in a notably performance improvement compared to a disjoint control, in terms of both energy savings and QoS guarantees. Moreover, our proposal has the advantage of being adaptable to the operator QoS requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets Using Dynamic Programming and CEC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.
