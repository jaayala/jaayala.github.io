However, HetNets have raised new issues related to cell association and interference management. In particular, the optimal configuration of interference coordination (IC) parameters is a challenging task because it depends on multiple stochastic processes such as the locations of the users, the traffic demands, or the strength of the received signals. This work proposes a self-optimization algorithm capable of finding the optimal configuration in an operating network. We address the problem using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, in which the actions are the IC configurations, whose performances are initially unknown. The main difficulty is that, due to the variable network conditions, the performance of each action may change over time. Our proposal is based on two main elements: the sequential exploration of subsets of actions (exploration regions), and an optimal stopping strategy for deciding when to end current exploration and start a new one. For our algorithm, referred to as Local Exploration with Optimal Stopping (LEOS), we provide theoretical bounds on its long-term regret per sample and its convergence time. We compare LEOS to stateof-the-art learning algorithms based on multi-armed bandits and policy gradient RL. Considering different changing rates in the network conditions, our numerical results show that LEOS outperforms the first alternative by 22%, and the second one by 48% in terms of average regret per sample.","tags":null,"title":"Online Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Interference Coordination","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

The dependency between computing resources and radio channel conditions makes vRAN resource control particularly daunting. We present vrAIn, a vRAN dynamic resource controller that builds upon deep reinforcement learning, which we implement using using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. First, vrAIn uses an autoencoder that projects the large context space (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, vrAIn uses a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, implemented by an actor-critic neural network structure, and a simple classifier to map (encoded) contexts into appropriate resource control decisions. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control decisions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over a CPU-unaware approach while paying a very small price in performance; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over a static allocation policy that uses the same CPU resources; and (iii) it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art approaches upon CPU capacity shortage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the computational behavior of vRAN, and the first approach to a model-free solution that does not need to assume any particular vRAN platform or system conditions.","tags":null,"title":"vrAIn: A Deep Learning Approach Tailoring Computing and Radio Resources in Virtualized RANs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

However, this strategy has strong interactions with interference coordination (IC) mechanisms, making it convenient to address both tasks simultaneously. The motivation of this paper is to develop a self-optimization algorithm capable of jointly controlling energy saving and IC mechanisms using an online learning approach. Our proposal is based on a contextual bandit formulation that, among other challenges, implies discovering the most energy-efficient control actions while satisfying a predefined level of Quality of Service (QoS) for the users. We propose a two-level framework comprising a global controller, in charge of a group of macro cells, and multiple local controllers, one per macro cell. The global controller implements a novel algorithm, referred to as the Bayesian Response Estimation and Threshold Search (BRETS), that is capable of learning, for each control action, its feasibility boundaries in terms of QoS and its energy consumption as a function of the aggregated user traffic. The algorithm comes with a bound on its expected convergence time. The local controllers translate the control actions learned by the global controller into local decisions. Our numerical results show that BRETS is only 1% less efficient than an ideal oracle policy, clearly outperforming other benchmark algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Online Learning for Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

On the other hand, interference coordination is a key aspect in HetNets resource management which directly affects the performance and energy consumption. Although these two aspect are intertwined, they have been studied separately so far. In this paper, we address the joint problem of energy saving and interference coordination in HetNets. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) leveraging two facts: the user traffic demands usually follow periodic patterns, and the knowledge and prediction of network load is crucial in order to select efficient network configurations. Quality of Service (QoS) in the network is defined as the ratio of users meeting a requirement specified by the operator, and allows us to account for a minimum QoS requirement by including a constraint in the formulation of the MDP. To address this MDP, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm which selects energy efficient farsighted configurations with QoS guarantees achieving near optimal performance. This ADP algorithm is built upon: 1) the certainty equivalent control principle, which simplifies the complexity of the MDP, and 2) machine learning techniques: a neural network and a polynomial regressor which allow us to predict the QoS and the consumption of the network in advance. We evaluate our proposal in a LTE-A network simulator following the 3GPP guidelines, and the results obtained show that a joint control of the energy saving and interference coordination mechanisms results in a notably performance improvement compared to a disjoint control, in terms of both energy savings and QoS guarantees. Moreover, our proposal has the advantage of being adaptable to the operator QoS requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets Using Dynamic Programming and CEC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

The NN classifier is dynamically trained to choose a subset of configurations (i.e., feasible configurations in terms of QoS) based on the context information (network state).

These global configurations are interpreted by the local controllers on each network sector. This scheme allows the learning agent to progressively learn the best policy by observing the network state and the performance of the chosen configurations in terms of energy consumption and QoS.
