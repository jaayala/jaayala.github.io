Yet, many practical applications have critical constraints for operation in real environments. Most learning solutions often neglect the risk of failing to meet these constraints, hindering their implementation in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware decision-making framework for contextual bandit problems, accommodating constraints and continuous action spaces. Our approach employs an actor multi-critic architecture, with each critic characterizing the distribution of performance and constraint metrics. Our framework is designed to cater to various risk levels, effectively balancing constraint satisfaction against performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we first compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods in a synthetic environment, highlighting the impact of intrinsic environmental noise across different risk configurations. Finally, we evaluate our framework in a real-world use case involving a 5G mobile network where only our approach consistently satisfies the system constraint (a signal processing reliability target) with a small performance toll (8.5% increase in power consumption).","tags":null,"title":"Risk-Aware Continuous Control with Neural Contextual Bandits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fatih Aslan","George Iosifidis","Jose A.

This paper presents first a series of experiments which assess the O-Cloud's energy costs and their dependency on the servers' hardware, capacity and data traffic properties which, typically, change over time. Next, it proposes a compute policy for assigning the base station data loads to O-Cloud servers in an energy-efficient fashion; and a radio policy that determines at near-real-time the minimum transmission block size for each user so as to avoid unnecessary energy costs. The policies balance energy savings with performance, and ensure that both of them are dispersed fairly across the servers and users, respectively. To cater for the unknown and time-varying parameters affecting the policies, we develop a novel online learning framework with fairness guarantees that apply to the entire operation horizon of the system (long-term fairness). The policies are evaluated using trace-driven simulations and are fully implemented in an O-RAN compatible system where we measure the energy costs and throughput in realistic scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Fair Resource Allocation in Virtualized O-RAN Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Lo Schiavo","Jose A.

In addition, this proposal is flexible enough to support different levels of user privacy and the advent of new advertising markets with more heterogeneous data. In contrast to most of the current advertising platforms that are based on click-through rate models using a fixed input format and rely on user tracking, KRAF integrates the heterogeneous available data (e.g., contextual features, interest-based attributes, information about ads) as graph nodes to generate their dense representation (embeddings). Then, our MARL algorithm leverages the embeddings of the entities to learn efficient budget allocation strategies. To that end, we propose a novel coordination strategy based on a mean-field style to coordinate the learning agents and avoid the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents grows. Our proposal is evaluated on three real-world datasets to assess its performance and the contribution of each of its components, outperforming several baseline methods in terms of ROAS and number of ad clicks.","tags":null,"title":"KRAF: A Flexible Advertising Framework using Knowledge Graph-Enriched Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

Using data-driven simulations we find that multi-CU vRANs achieve cost savings up to 28% and improve centralization by 77%, compared to single-CU vRANs. Interestingly, we see non-trivial trade-offs among centralization and cost, which can be aligned or conflicting based on the traffic and network parameters.

This work proposes a self-optimization algorithm capable of finding the optimal configuration in an operating network. We address the problem using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, in which the actions are the IC configurations, whose performances are initially unknown. The main difficulty is that, due to the variable network conditions, the performance of each action may change over time. Our proposal is based on two main elements: the sequential exploration of subsets of actions (exploration regions), and an optimal stopping strategy for deciding when to end current exploration and start a new one. For our algorithm, referred to as Local Exploration with Optimal Stopping (LEOS), we provide theoretical bounds on its long-term regret per sample and its convergence time. We compare LEOS to stateof-the-art learning algorithms based on multi-armed bandits and policy gradient RL.

We propose a two-level framework comprising a global controller, in charge of a group of macro cells, and multiple local controllers, one per macro cell. The global controller implements a novel algorithm, referred to as the Bayesian Response Estimation and Threshold Search (BRETS), that is capable of learning, for each control action, its feasibility boundaries in terms of QoS and its energy consumption as a function of the aggregated user traffic. The algorithm comes with a bound on its expected convergence time. The local controllers translate the control actions learned by the global controller into local decisions. Our numerical results show that BRETS is only 1% less efficient than an ideal oracle policy, clearly outperforming other benchmark algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Online Learning for Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

On the other hand, interference coordination is a key aspect in HetNets resource management which directly affects the performance and energy consumption. Although these two aspect are intertwined, they have been studied separately so far. In this paper, we address the joint problem of energy saving and interference coordination in HetNets. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) leveraging two facts: the user traffic demands usually follow periodic patterns, and the knowledge and prediction of network load is crucial in order to select efficient network configurations. Quality of Service (QoS) in the network is defined as the ratio of users meeting a requirement specified by the operator, and allows us to account for a minimum QoS requirement by including a constraint in the formulation of the MDP. To address this MDP, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm which selects energy efficient farsighted configurations with QoS guarantees achieving near optimal performance. This ADP algorithm is built upon: 1) the certainty equivalent control principle, which simplifies the complexity of the MDP, and 2) machine learning techniques: a neural network and a polynomial regressor which allow us to predict the QoS and the consumption of the network in advance. We evaluate our proposal in a LTE-A network simulator following the 3GPP guidelines, and the results obtained show that a joint control of the energy saving and interference coordination mechanisms results in a notably performance improvement compared to a disjoint control, in terms of both energy savings and QoS guarantees. Moreover, our proposal has the advantage of being adaptable to the operator QoS requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets Using Dynamic Programming and CEC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

We propose a semi-distributed scheme consisting of a learning agent and local controllers. The learning agent comprises a neural network (NN) classifier and a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm. The NN classifier is dynamically trained to choose a subset of configurations (i.e., feasible configurations in terms of QoS) based on the context information (network state). Then, the MAB algorithm picks one control (i.e., global configuration parameters) among those selected by the NN classifier, with the aim of improving the energy efficiency. These global configurations are interpreted by the local controllers on each network sector. This scheme allows the learning agent to progressively learn the best policy by observing the network state and the performance of the chosen configurations in terms of energy consumption and QoS. Our numerical results show an energy saving close to 20% with respect to a default policy and an improvement of 13% with respect to addressing energy saving and interference coordination separately.","tags":null,"title":"Contextual Bandit Approach for Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

The objective consists of optimizing a performance metric for which, in general, mathematical expression is unavailable. In particular, we consider the fifth percentile throughput defined by the 3GPP. By means of RSM, our mechanism obtains local approximations of the objective function to perform steepest ascent iterations with an adjustable level of statistical accuracy. The algorithm can be extended to account for stochastic constraints, allowing the network to optimize one performance metric while maintaining other metrics above a desired level.","tags":null,"title":"Online Optimization of Interference Coordination Parameters in Small Cell Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose A.

However, HAs are expensive and energy-hungry, which increases costs and has serious environmental implications. To address this problem, we gather data from our experimental platform and compare the performance and energy consumption of a HA (NVIDIA GPU V100) vs. a CPU (Intel Xeon Gold 6240R, 16 cores) for energy-friendly software processing. Based on the insights obtained from this data, we devise a strategy to offload workloads to HAs opportunistically to save energy while preserving reliability. This offloading strategy, however, needs to be configured in near-real-time for every BS sharing common computational resources. This renders a challenging multi-agent collaborative problem in which the number of involved agents (BSs) can be arbitrarily large and can change over time. Thus, we propose an efficient multi-agent contextual bandit algorithm called ECORAN, which applies concepts from mean field theory to be fully scalable. Using a real platform and traces from a production mobile network, we show that ECORAN can provide up to 40% energy savings with respect to the approach used today by the industry.","tags":null,"title":"Mean-Field Multi-Agent Contextual Bandit for Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in vRANs","type":"publication"}]
